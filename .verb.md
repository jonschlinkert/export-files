## Usage

Specify the directory with files to export:

```js
module.exports = require('export-files')(__dirname);
//=> {a: [function], b: [function], c: [function]}
```

## Changes

**v0.2.0 - breaking changes**

- Non-javascript files are no longer handled. That functionality was moved to [to-exports][]. This decision was made to keep this lib as fast as possible.
- This library no longer takes any arguments besides the directory to read.
